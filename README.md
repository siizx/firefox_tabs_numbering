Firefox tabs numbering: Firefox add-on that numbers each tab in order to facilitate tab-switching to users who use keyboard shortcuts.
Thought for i3 file manager users.

- Remember:
In Firefox, the keyboard shortcuts Alt + 1 through Alt + 8 allow you to switch to the corresponding tab from left to right. Alt + 9 will switch to the last tab, regardless of how many tabs are open.
However, thereâ€™s no built-in keyboard shortcut to directly switch to tabs numbered 10 and above. If you need to navigate through a large number of tabs, you can use the following shortcuts:

    Ctrl + Tab: This will switch to the next tab.
    Ctrl + Shift + Tab: This will switch to the previous tab.
